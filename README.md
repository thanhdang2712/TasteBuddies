# TasteBuddies

## Motivation
TasteBuddies aims to fill a gap in existing food applications by focusing on the dishes themselves rather than specific restaurants or locations. Our goal is to create a social platform for food enthusiasts to connect, share culinary experiences, maintain a food diary, and exchange stories with friends. TasteBuddies fosters a vibrant community where users can explore new flavors, discover favorite dishes, and engage with like-minded individuals.
